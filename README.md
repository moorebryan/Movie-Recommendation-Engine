# Movie-Recommendation-Engine

This uses a combination of two datasets, both found on Kaggle. One can be downloaded from here:
https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data/kernels
and the other can be downloaded from here:
https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

Not all files will be used, but if you take all files and put them in the same folder as the code the program should be able to run correctly.
