# Movie-Recommendation-Engine

This uses a combination of two datasets, both found on Kaggle. One can be downloaded from here:

<br>and the other can be downloaded from here:<br>

Not all files will be used, but if you take all files and put them in the same folder as the code the program should be able to run correctly.

The same datasets are used for both the Pearson Similarity approach and the SVM approach.

These codes are some of the first I ever wrote which implement Machine Learning algorithms. As such I did not make full use of the power of these approaches. At one point I plan on going back and rewriting these codes to process the data much more efficiently and accurately. As it stands, no cross-fold optimization or assessment of error has even been built into the approaches.
